I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Claremont Graduate University. My research interests are in the economics of crime and homelessness. I am particularly interested in the human capital impacts of homelessness, and I am deeply motivated by a longstanding interest to enhance public safety. Methodologically, I hope to utilize quasi-experimental research designs to understand the consequences of homelessness and to assess the impact of policies designed to mitigate it.

I received my undergraduate education in economics from UCLA and went on to pursue a master's degree in economics from San Diego State University.
