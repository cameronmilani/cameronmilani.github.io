I am a first year Ph.D. student in Economics at Claremont Graduate University. My research interests are in labor economics,  environmental economics, and health economics. I am particularly interested in the labor and human capital impacts of discrimination, and I am deeply motivated by a longstanding interest to enhance economic mobility for populations that are often discriminated against. Methodologically, I hope to utilize quasi-experimental research designs to understand the consequences of discrimination and to assess the impact of policies designed to mitigate it.

I received my undergraduate education in economics from UCLA and went on to pursue a master's degree in economics from San Diego State University.
