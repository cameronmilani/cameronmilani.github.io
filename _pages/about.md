I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Claremont Graduate University. My interests are in labor economics and environmental economics. I am particularly interested in the labor and human capital impacts of workforce training, and I am deeply motivated by a longstanding interest to enhance economic mobility for underserved populations. Methodologically, I utilize quasi-experimental research designs to evaluate program efficacy and to assess the impact that various skills have on job readiness.

I received my undergraduate education in economics from UCLA and went on to pursue a master's degree in economics from San Diego State University.
